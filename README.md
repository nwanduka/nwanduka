> Disclaimer:
My portfolio—like me—is a work in progress. The current content reflects my earlier journey in UX design and may not fully represent where I am now in tech. I've recently bought a domain and plan to rebuild this site myself as a personal project once I’ve gained more hands-on experience in cloud engineering.
